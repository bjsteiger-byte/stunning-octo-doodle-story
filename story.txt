	Brad sits in the 1366 CS Linux lab every Monday with his sesame chicken bento bowl from Ginger Root.
There was something nice about having a bit of sweet spice as he wrote lines and lines of code for his various
projects. However, there was something different about this chicken today, something about the flavor felt off.
Being busy with his work, Brad shrugged it off and continued to shovel fried rice and chicken down his gullet.
What Brad didn't know was what happend with the particular chicken that he was eating. See years ago there was
a scientist named Dan who created a circuit that spliced the chickens OCA2 gene giving it laser vision. Now brad,
unsuspecting, was eating that chicken. 
	As he scraped the bottom of styrofoam container, Brad felt something change. He felt the acid in his stomach
envelop the greasy chicken, and felt more than a little queasy. "Argh. Everything is falling apart! First the
impossible programs and now my favorite chicken turns on me!" This was the last straw. Brad pushed his chair back and
aggressively shut his laptop's lid. The fiery sensation in his stomach now coursed through his veins. He made an equally fiery
exit from room 1366.
